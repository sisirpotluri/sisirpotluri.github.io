Project: Sisir Potluri's Website

This is a website I coded using mostly HTML and CSS as well as some Javascript. 
It has contact information, interests, work, and links to my other profiles.

Designing this website gave me a basic understanding of how to use HTML and CSS, and I hope to develop more complex websites in the future.
