Project: Sisir Potluri's Website

This is a portfolio website designed to showcase my programming experience and recent projects. It's based off of a template provided by Colorlib, and I modified it with a unique theme and functionality. I learned advanced topics in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while developing this website.
